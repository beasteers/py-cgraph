    "# Computational Graphs - Symbolic Computation\n",
    "*Christoph Heindl 2017, https://github.com/cheind/py-cgraph/*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part two in a series about computational graphs and their applications. The first part covered theoretical foundations of computational graphs and algorithms to perform forward function evaluation and backward derivative computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will focus on developing Python code that allows numeric and symbolic differentiation of arbitrary (real valued) functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CGraph \n",
    "\n",
    "CGraph is the name of the Python library to be developed during the remainder of this notebook. While the code inside the notebook is functional, a separate, self-contained and enhanced implementation of CGraph is available [cgraph.py](https://github.com/cheind/py-cgraph). The most striking difference is that the provided code supports more built-in functions and supports evaluating multiple parameter sets at once making it more performant than the notebook version.\n",
    "\n",
    "CGraph performs numeric and symbolic differentiation using backpropagation. The code below shows a sample session.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cgraph as cg\n",
    "\n",
    "x = cg.Symbol('x')\n",
    "y = cg.Symbol('y')\n",
    "z = cg.Symbol('z')\n",
    "\n",
    "f = (x * y + 3) / (z - 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate function\n",
    "cg.value(f, {x:2, y:3, z:3}) # 9.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Partial derivatives (numerically)\n",
    "d = cg.numeric_gradient(f, {x:2, y:3, z:3})\n",
    "d[x] # df/dx 3.0\n",
    "d[z] # df/dz -9.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Partial derivatives (symbolically)\n",
    "d = cg.symbolic_gradient(f)\n",
    "cg.simplify(d[x]) # (y*(1/(z - 2)))\n",
    "cg.value(d[x], {x:2, y:3, z:3}) # 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Higher order derivatives\n",
    "ddx = cg.symbolic_gradient(d[x])\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.5 will be used for development. The reader is assumed to be familiar with its concepts including generators and decorators. Also a technique called monkey patching will be used to iteratively refine classes introduced previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expression trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into code, we need to cover the concept of [expression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree). Expression trees will be used to represent function decompositions. While they are not a fundamentally new concept they deserve some words at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression tree is similar to the computational graphs introduced, but the arrows by default point backwards. It turns out that representing functions in a tree like manner (top node is the function itself, function parameters are leafs) simplifies development dramatically compared to CGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the CG of the toy example used $f(x,y)=(x+y)x$\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/intro_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following expression tree represents the same function\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/exp_tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we now have a tree like structure. Our root node is the final operation to be executed to receive the result of $f(x,y)$. $x$ shows up twice now. Finding the value of an expression tree requires to compute values of nodes in lower layers first and bubble information up towards the root node. Backpropagation on the other hand can start at the root and then follow the forward edges. When computing derivatives not much changes: we will have a summation over all paths from the top that lead to a given node and every node will perform the product of two terms (chain rule) that is send to its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing expression trees\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to come up with a way to represent expression trees. In CGraph we will have a base class `Node` that manages child references. Derived classes will actually implement operations, symbols and constants."

    " 1. Add implementations for `compute_value`, `symbolic_gradient` and for `compute_gradient`\n",
    " 1. Provide one or more free function with prefix `sym_*` that connects arguments as inputs for your operation. Use `@wrap_args` where appropriate.\n",
    " 1. Optionally provide `__str__`\n",
    " 1. Optionally add new `__*__` methods in `Node` to support improved syntax delegating to `sym_*` methods.\n",
    " \n",
    "A word of caution: when computing numeric gradients through `compute_gradient` you might find yourself in a position of potentially dividing by zero or raising any other math expection. When this happens, gradient computation will stop. For example consider $f(x,y) = x^y$ and let $x=-1, y=2$. Then when evaluating the gradient for $y$ you will find that it corresponds to $x^y*log(x)$. Unfortunately $x$ is negative and so the value can not be computed. Python raises an exception and gradient computation fails. Now assume that you are not interested in the derivative with respect to $y$ at all, still you will get no result as gradient computation stopped after the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "CGraph handles this by using `NAN`s instead of exceptions. Almost all operations that invoke `NAN`s result in `NAN`, so they propagate nicely. [CGraph](https://github.com/cheind/py-cgraph) uses numpy arrays as a basic container for values. Numpy by default turns these exceptions into `NAN` and issues a warning.\n",

Not only will this improve readability, but also give a better performance as lesser nodes need to be evaluated (pays off especially when you invoke it many times after simplification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way CGraph implements expression simplification is by traversing the computational graph while trying to apply simplification rules. Each rule acts on a single node and may produce a simplier version of that node. The new node 'replaces' the old node in an expression tree that is formed in parallel. That means that we won't fiddle around with the original expression tree given, but rather generate a expression tree that represents a simplified version of the original one.\n",
