    "# Computational Graphs - Symbolic Computation\n",
    "*Christoph Heindl 2017, https://github.com/cheind/py-cgraph/*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part two in a series about computational graphs and their applications. The first part covered theoretical foundations of computational graphs and associated algorithms to perform forward function evaluation and backward derivative computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will focus on developing Python code that allows numeric and symbolic differentiation of arbitrary (real valued) functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CGraph \n",
    "\n",
    "CGraph is the name of the Python library to be developed during the remainder of this notebook. While the code inside the notebook is functional a separate, self-contained and enhanced implementation of CGraph is available [cgraph.py](../cgraph.py). \n",
    "\n",
    "CGraph performs numeric and symbolic differentiation using backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import cgraph as cg\n",
    "\n",
    "x = cg.Symbol('x')\n",
    "y = cg.Symbol('y')\n",
    "z = cg.Symbol('z')\n",
    "\n",
    "f = (x * y + 3) / (z - 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate function\n",
    "cg.value(f, {x:2, y:3, z:3}) # 9.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Partial derivatives (numerically)\n",
    "d = cg.numeric_gradient(f, {x:2, y:3, z:3})\n",
    "d[x] # df/dx 3.0\n",
    "d[z] # df/dz -9.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Partial derivatives (symbolically)\n",
    "d = cg.symbolic_gradient(f)\n",
    "cg.simplify(d[x]) # (y*(1/(z - 2)))\n",
    "cg.value(d[x], {x:2, y:3, z:3}) # 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Higher order derivatives\n",
    "ddx = cg.symbolic_gradient(d[x])\n",
    "cg.simplify(ddx[y]) # ddf/dxdy\n",
    "# (1/(z - 2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.5 will be used for development. The reader is assumed to be familiar with its concepts including generators and decorators. Also a technique called monkey patching will be used to iteratively refine classes already introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expression trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into code, we need to cover the concept of [expression trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree). Expression trees will be used to represent function decompositions in Python code to be developed. While there are not a fundamentally new concept they deserve some words at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression tree is similar to the computational graphs introduced, but the arrows by default point backwards. It turns out that constructing function expression in a tree like manner (top node is the function itself, function parameters are leafs) simplifies development dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the CG of the toy example used $f(x,y)=(x+y)x$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"intro_0.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The following expression tree represents the same function\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"exp_tree.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we now have a tree like structure. Our root node is the final operation to be executed to receive the result of $f(x,y)$. Also notice that $x$ shows up twice. Finding the value of an expression tree requires to compute values for nodes in lower layers first and bubble information up towards the root node. Backpropagation on the other hand ist just a matter of following the forward edges. Again, when computing derivatives, a summation over all paths from the top that lead to a given node will be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing expression trees\n",
    "First we need to come up with a way to represent expression that were introducted in the previous part. trees in Python code. Naturally, we will have base class `Node` that manages child references and derived classes that actually implement operations, symbols and constants."
