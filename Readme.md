## CGraph - symbolic computation in Python library

This library is the result of my efforts to understand symbolic computation of
functions factored as expression trees. In a few lines of code it shows how to
forward evaluate functions and how to perform numeric and symbolic derivatives
computations using backpropagation.

While this library is not complete (and will never be) it offers the interested
reader some insights on how to perform symbolic computation.

The code is accompanied by a series of notebooks that explain fundamental
concepts and guide you through developing your own library that performs symbolic computation:

    1. [00 Computational Graphs - Introduction](docs/00 Computational Graphs - Introduction.ipynb)
    1. [01 Computational Graphs - Symbolic Computation](docs/01 Computational Graphs - Symbolic Computation.ipynb)
    1. [02 Computational Graphs - Function Optimization](docs/02 Computational Graphs - Function Optimization.ipynb)

The series is not complete and I'm planning more parts (neural networks for instance), however my time is limited and I'm not sure when I can come up with these.

There are certainly plenty of typos, grammatical errors and all kind of improvements possible. In case you have one for me, I'd be happy to see your pull requests or comments.
