## CGraph - symbolic computation in Python

This repository is the result of my efforts to understand symbolic computation of
functions factored as expression trees. With the right concepts at hands a few lines of code can compute numeric and symbolic gradients of arbitrary functions. Even expression simplification is easily accomplished. While this library is not complete (and will never be) it offers the interested reader some insights on how to perform symbolic computation.

The code is accompanied by a series of notebooks that explain fundamental concepts and hints for developing your own library that performs symbolic computation:

1. [00 Computational Graphs - Introduction](docs/00_Computational_Graphs-Introduction.ipynb)
1. [01 Computational Graphs - Symbolic Computation](docs/01_Computational_Graphs-Symbolic_Computation.ipynb)
1. [02 Computational Graphs - Function Optimization](docs/02_Computational_Graphs-Function_Optimization.ipynb)

There are certainly plenty of typos, grammatical errors and all kind of improvements possible. In case you have one for me, I'd be happy to see your pull requests or comments.
